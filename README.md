### Thank You!

Remember this is a free release developed on free time, either for personal use or as custom requests.

Any contribution is welcome.

Repository note: this is simply a new repository for my previous changed variant found previously at: https://github.com/vintagedaddyo/MyBB-jQuery-Color-Picker now moved as many other changes have been made to this since so I opted to move to new repo and remove the forked repository..
